[z_calibration]

## update these variable according to the documentation here https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration
## you then should call CALIBRATE_Z as one of the last lines on your PRINT_START to set the Z offset dinamically

#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the nozzle on the
#   Z endstop.
nozzle_xy_position: 204,298
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the probe's switch body
#   on the Z endstop.
switch_xy_position: 198,278
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
#   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
#   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
#   configured.
bed_xy_position: 150,150

wiggle_xy_offsets: 0,0
#   After probing the nozzle and retracting, move x some distance away and
#   back. Useful to prevent the z endstop pin sticking to the nozzle and
#   being pulled out of the assembly. Can be negative. Defaults to zero to
#   disable it. Can be combined in x and y to move diagonally. Be careful
#   to not move your nozzle out of range!


switch_offset: 0.323
#  70 The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
offset_margins: -2.5,1.5
#   The minimum and maximum margins allowed for the calculated offset.
#   If the offset is outside these values, it will stop!
#   The margin can be defined as "min,max" e.g. "-0.5,1.5" or by just one
#   value e.g. "1.0" which translates to "-1.0,1.0" (which is also the default).
samples: 2
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance: 0.015
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance_retries: 3
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_result: median
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
safe_z_height: 10
position_min: -10
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
speed: 200
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
lift_speed: 7
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
probing_speed: 15
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
probing_second_speed: 4
#   Distance to back off (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: 0.7
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
probing_first_fast: true
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.

start_gcode: 
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode: Attach_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: g4
#Dock_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
